                    June 2017- July 2018<br>
                    I worked alongside with professional chemical engineers to collect samples of malt used in the germination process of beer. I oversaw daily data collection on paper as well as synchronizing it with the company database. This also required me to send and recieve data from providers and other malt processing plants.<br>
